Latest studies by IAB show that European digital advertising market is growing in double digits year over year, while Social is fueling display growth across Europe, growing 33.7 percent year over year (reference link).

As advertising budgets scale rapidly with double digit growth, marketing teams around the world are often unclear when it comes to understanding Marketing ROI due to inefficient data analytics processes and operations. Data blindspots are inevitable as the average marketer uses at least 12 different platforms while managing ads, email automation, web analytics, social media, search, SEO and more. Improvado’s aim is to become the dominant brand for marketing aggregation software that can also handle things like piping data into insight engines that include AI, predictive and prescriptive analytics models.
