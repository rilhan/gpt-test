Improvado helps marketing teams find answers in data, effortlessly.

Marketing reporting and campaign monitoring are largely manual routines and a huge hassle. On average, marketing teams:
‍
· leverage up to 92 marketing platforms and tools, daily
· spend 20-40% of their time reporting on efforts
· handle endless data exports and spreadsheets
· struggle normalizing data and routing it to dashboards
· believe that the increasing data complexity is a major blocker to applying and activating marketing data
· attribute revenue to touchpoints across customer journeys.
